### Project Overview
My project used data analysis to identify the best genre of movies to produce based on popularity and net profits.


### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.


### DATA
The data used for this project was from 6 datasets from the following websites :
. Box Office MojoLinks 
IMDBLinks 
Rotten TomatoesLinks 
TheMovieDBLinks 
The NumbersLinks 
### Hypothesis

The focus of my analysis was on the type of movie classified as genres. Thus I analyzed what genres are the highest grossing, bring in the greatest net profit and are the most popular , in order to determine what actions Microsoft's new studio should take. I filtered my data based on year thus retaining data from 2010 upwards.
### Jupyter Notebook
My notebook is structured into two segments. Data Cleaning being the first and Data Analysis and Visualisation being the second. I cleaned each data frame separately, filtering out most nul values and replacing remainder based on the data presented. 

For analysis and visualisation purposes I extraced either the top 20,50,100 or 1000 movies depending on how large the data set was and ordered them by factors such as net profit, popularity ,genre etc. In order to determine the best genres, I used the value counts of the genres in the top movies to see how many times the genres were represented and get reliable results for my conclusions.

## Presentation
I then created a presentation showing the key takeaways of my analysis and providing three insights on how Microsoft Studio should proceed and what movies they should focus on making.
